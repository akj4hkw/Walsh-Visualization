## TOPIC

General Topic/Overview: **Contextualizing Sports Absurdities and Performance**

For this report, the focus is on contextualizing the extraordinary and historic achievement of Gretchen Walsh's record-breaking 100 butterfly swim on March 22nd, 2024 at the 2024 NCAA Division I Women's Championships.

**Important Notes/Abbreviations:**

- W = Women's, M = Men's
- SCY = Short Course Yards (NCAA Distance)
- Fly = Butterfly

*Short Course Yards (SCY)* refers to the length of the pool/lane. SCY swims take place in pools/lane that are 25 yards in length. This differs from other formats such as LCY (Long Course Yards: 50 yards), SCM (Short Course Meters: 25 meters), and LCM (Long Course Meters: 50 meters).

Swim events follow this format: Gender, Distance, Stroke, Measurement. For example, *W 100 Fly SCY* stands for Women's 100 Yard Butterfly, Short Course Yards.

## QUESTIONS

* How does Gretchen Walsh's performance in the 100 fly compare to other top performers in the same event over recent years?

* How has the Short Course Yards (SCY) Women's 100 Fly record changed over time, and what role did Gretchen Walsh play in its evolution? How does Walsh's performance compare to previous record-breaking achievements in the same event?

* How significant is Gretchen Walsh's record-breaking performance in the broader historical context of SCY achievements? To what extent did Walsh's swim demonstrate dominance in the sport?

## AUDIENCE

Fans of swimming, sports enthusiasts, analysts, and journalists interested in understanding and appreciating the significance of Gretchen Walsh's achievement.

## DATA

The data for this analysis was obtained from two main sources on March 23rd & 24th, 2024:

1. **USA Swimming**: The national governing body for competitive swimming in the United States. They collect and store data from officially sanctioned meets across the country. The data accessed included:
    - [Top 100 Performers SCY W 100 Fly](https://www.usaswimming.org/times/popular-resources/event-rank-search) (Record Progress.csv): Data on the top 100 performers in the SCY Women's 100 Fly event from 2020 to 2024, including their times and ranks.
    
    | Variable | Information |
|:-|:-|
| Time | Length (in Seconds) of the Swim |
| Athlete | Name of the Athlete |
| Swim Date | Date of the Swim |
    - [All Time Top Performances W 100 Fly SCY Fly](https://www.usaswimming.org/times/data-hub/all-time-top-performers) (Top Performers.csv): Data on the top all time W 100 Fly SCY performances, including the swim date, time, and athlete details.
    
  | Variable | Information |
|:-|:-|
| Rank | Rank of the Swim in the Competition Year |
| Time | Length (in Seconds) of the Swim |
| Full Name | Name of the Athlete|
| Age | Age of the Athlete |
| LSC | Local Swimming Committee (local governing body) |
| Event | Name of the Event (ex: 100 FL SCY) |
| Meet Name | Name of the Meet (ex: 2024 NCAA Division I Women's Championships)|
| Time Standard | Which Meet Does this Swim Meet the Cutoff for? (ex: 2024 Summer Nationals) |
| Competition Year | Competition Year of Swim | 


2. **SwimSwam**: A popular swimming news organization known for its coverage of premier swimming events. The data accessed from SwimSwam included:
    - [SwimSwam: Gretchen Walsh's Absurd Performance](https://swimswam.com/trying-to-contextualize-the-absurdity-of-gretchen-walshs-47-42-in-the-100-fly/) (Gap.csv): Data on the record percentage time difference in all NCAA Championship Meet SCY events, highlighting the significance of Gretchen Walsh's performance. For context, the percentage time difference in SCY event gaps is a common metric used to assess dominance in collegiate swimming. It compares the performance of interest, such as Gretchen Walsh's SCY 100 Fly, with the slowest swim in the 'B Final' (16th place). This comparison allows for a more accurate assessment of a swimmer's dominance relative to their peers, especially compared to simply comparing against the next fastest swimmer, which may not accurately reflect historical dominance.
    
    
| Variable | Information |
|:-|:-|
| Event | Name of the Event (ex: W 100 Fly) |
| 1st | Name of the Winning Athlete (1st in the 'A Final')  |
| Time 1st | The Length (in Seconds) of the Winning Athlete's Swim |
| 16th | Name of the Last Athlete (16th Overall, 8th in the 'B Final')  |
| Time 16th | The Length (in Seconds) of the Last Athlete's Swim |
| Gap | Percentage Time Difference Between 1st and 16th |
